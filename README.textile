h1. Introduction

This is "Alex Payne":http://al3x.net/'s Emacs configuration. It's not designed to be a "starter kit":http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/tree/master. It's just some dude's preferred way to edit stuff.

h1. Notes

* Only tested under Emacs.app (--with-ns) on OS X; may not work with Aquamacs.
* Not uncomfortable to use on a Mac, but also not explictly Mac-like.
* Assumes option/alt is Meta, command/Apple is Super.
* Probably more comfortable if you set caps lock to ctrl.
* Assumes that you want to use Emacs for editing and your shell, but probably not serious email and web browsing.

h1. Supported Languages

* Scala
* Ruby (and Rails)
* JavaScript
* Textile
* YAML
* more!
